  summary: "Request an OAuth2 access token"
  description: |
    Most endpoints in UWA require that you authenticate the user before hand. This is done by passing credentials that allow uwa to check if these credentials are
    genuine and authentication is successful. In that case you receive an access token that must be used where authorization is required to access the resources of the user.

    Before requesting an access token you need a client that identifies your application that will act on behalf of the user. Such a client needs to be created in the admin panel.
    It will have an id and a secret that need to be used in all authentication requests. Consult the "getting started" chapter

    Additionally a client is coupled to one of our tree brands limiting the access to only the endpoints of that specific brand.

    An access token will only be valid for a certain amount of time; given by the `expires_in` attribute. So it needs to be refreshed from time to time. To avoid
    to request the user for his credentials each time, a refresh token can be used. You receive a refresh token with each access token.

    This means you have two way of acquiring an access token:

    - via user credentials (password grant)

    - via a refresh token (refresh_token grant)

    You can indicate which method of authentication you will use by specifing the grant type. Depending on the grant type the parameters you must give differ.

    For password grants, you must give a valid `username` and `password`
    For refresh token grants, you must give specify `refresh_token`

    Please note that in both case the data should be posted as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and you should give the client_id and optionally client_secret

    E.g. password grant

    ```
    curl -X post --data "grant_type=password&username=<username>&password=<password>&client_id=<client_id>&client_secret=<client_secret>" https://api.unleashed.be/jim/oauth2/token/

    <username> : the username of the end user. This can be a uid (Stievie), phone number (Jim), email (Mobile Vikings), these are the major cases per brand
    <password> : the password of the end user.
    <client_id> : the id of the client. You receive this information of Unleashed
    <client_secret> : the id of the client. You receive this information of Unleashed

    ```

    E.g. refresh token grant

    ```
    curl -X post --data "grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=<refresh_token>&client_id=<client_id>&client_secret=<client_secret>" https://api.unleashed.be/jim/oauth2/token/

    <refresh_token> : the refresh token you received together with the access token
    <client_id> : the id of the client. You receive this information of Unleashed
    <client_secret> : the id of the client. You receive this information of Unleashed

    ```

    Remark: upon password reset all tokens (access, refresh and grant) are invalidated. If you want to logout you should revoke the refresh and access token
