    This end point is used to order the products in the catalog.

    For our mobile brands:

    To migrate a subscription from postpaid to prepaid you need to specify a product, which corresponds with
    that subscription, and a topup. The topup can be specified using a child product.


    A migration from prepaid to postpaid just requires you to specify the product id of the chosen postpaid subscription.

        Only show orders with a status in the given, comma-separated list.

        There is one special case, the "wildcard" `not_final_or_with_mnp`
        which will return all orders that could need attention.
        In that case all other statuses in list will be ignored. As extra all orders with MNP will also be added.
